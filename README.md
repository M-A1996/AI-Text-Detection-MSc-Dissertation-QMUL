# 🧠 AI-Text-Detection-MSc-Dissertation-QMUL

**AI text detection systems** developed as part of my **MSc Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** dissertation at **Queen Mary University of London**.
This research investigates methods to **distinguish ChatGPT-generated content from human-written text** and explores strategies to **reduce hallucinations** and **enhance interpretability** in generative AI systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The project aims to address one of the most pressing challenges of the AI era—**identifying machine-generated text** in academic, journalistic, and social contexts. With the growing integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, distinguishing human from AI-produced content has become crucial for **academic integrity**, **ethical AI usage**, and **trustworthy information systems**.

Three different model architectures were developed, trained, and compared using the **`aadityaubhat/GPT-wiki-intro` dataset** (150,000+ Wikipedia introductions):

* 🪵 **Random Forest Classifier** — baseline machine-learning model using TF-IDF features.
* 🔁 **LSTM Neural Network** — deep learning model using GloVe embeddings for sequential text processing.
* ⚡ **BERT Transformer** — fine-tuned “bert-base-uncased” model leveraging Hugging Face Transformers.

The BERT-based model outperformed all others, achieving a **test accuracy of 97.5%** and a **perfect ROC-AUC score of 1.00**, demonstrating its robustness in differentiating AI-generated and human-written text.

## 🔍 Explainability & Ethical Considerations

A major focus of this research is **interpretability**.
The project incorporates explainability tools to highlight which linguistic features allow models to distinguish AI-generated text.
This approach promotes **responsible AI**, enabling stakeholders to understand and audit detection outcomes rather than relying on opaque “black-box” predictions.
